BACKEND TRUFFLE BUILD INSTRUCTIONS, READ VERY CAREFULLY

BASH SCRIPT:

./build_and_run.sh

---------------------------------------------------------

MANUAL WAY:

1. run ganache-cli on the command line
    ganache-cli
2. remove the build directory from the BACKEND
    rm -rf build
3. Compile the smart contract
    truffle compile --config truffle-config.cjs
4. Migrate the smart contract
    truffle migrate --config truffle-config.cjs
5. Run tests (test.js simulates a mock tied election)
    cd test
    node <your_test.js>

IF YOU DO NOT REBUILD IN THIS WAY ABOVE, TESTS MAY THROW ERRORS THAT VOTERS HAVE ALREADY VOTED


THEN:

6. Start the backend node server
    npm run dev
7. The backend is now ready to use, and exposes an API for:
    - Voting (submitting a vote)
    - Getting the count (checking who won!)
